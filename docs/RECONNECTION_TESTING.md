# Manual Testing Guide for Reconnection Fixes

## Overview
This guide outlines the manual testing scenarios to verify that the reconnection issues have been fixed in LumiFur.

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Bluetooth Power Cycle Reconnection
**Purpose**: Verify auto-reconnect works when Bluetooth is turned off and back on.

**Steps**:
1. Connect LumiFur to a peripheral device
2. Verify connection is stable and working
3. Turn off Bluetooth on the iOS device (Settings > Bluetooth > Off)
4. Wait 5 seconds
5. Turn Bluetooth back on
6. **Expected Result**: App should automatically attempt to reconnect to the last connected device

**Success Criteria**:
- Connection state shows "Reconnecting..." briefly
- Device reconnects automatically without user intervention
- All functionality resumes normally after reconnection

### 2. Unexpected Peripheral Disconnect
**Purpose**: Verify auto-reconnect works when peripheral disconnects unexpectedly.

**Steps**:
1. Connect LumiFur to a peripheral device
2. Verify connection is stable
3. Power off the peripheral device or move it out of range
4. Wait for disconnection to be detected
5. Power on the peripheral or bring it back in range
6. **Expected Result**: App should attempt to reconnect automatically

**Success Criteria**:
- App detects disconnection and shows "Reconnecting..." state
- App automatically attempts reconnection when device is available
- No need for manual reconnection

### 3. Manual Disconnect (Should NOT Auto-reconnect)
**Purpose**: Verify that manual disconnects do not trigger auto-reconnect.

**Steps**:
1. Connect LumiFur to a peripheral device
2. Use the app's disconnect button/feature to manually disconnect
3. **Expected Result**: App should NOT attempt to auto-reconnect

**Success Criteria**:
- Connection state shows "Disconnected"
- No automatic reconnection attempts
- User must manually reconnect if desired

### 4. Multiple Connection Attempts
**Purpose**: Verify the app handles multiple reconnection scenarios correctly.

**Steps**:
1. Connect to a device, then disconnect it unexpectedly
2. While reconnecting, turn Bluetooth off and on again
3. Let the device come back online
4. **Expected Result**: App should handle the state changes gracefully and reconnect

**Success Criteria**:
- No crashes or hangs during state transitions
- App eventually reconnects successfully
- Connection remains stable after reconnection

### 5. Bluetooth Authorization Issues
**Purpose**: Verify reconnection works after authorization issues are resolved.

**Steps**:
1. Revoke Bluetooth permissions for LumiFur (iOS Settings)
2. Try to use the app
3. Grant Bluetooth permissions when prompted
4. **Expected Result**: App should be able to reconnect to previously connected devices

## Expected Improvements

With the fixes applied, you should see:

1. **Faster Reconnection**: Less delay in reconnection attempts
2. **More Reliable Auto-reconnect**: Auto-reconnect should work consistently
3. **Better State Management**: Connection states should update properly
4. **No Threading Issues**: No hangs or crashes during reconnection
5. **Proper Flag Management**: Auto-reconnect flag should not get stuck

## Debugging Information

If issues persist, check the console logs for:
- "Auto-reconnect to [UUID]" messages
- "Retrieving peripheral for auto-reconnect" messages  
- Any threading-related errors
- Connection state transitions

## Notes

- Auto-reconnect is enabled by default (`autoReconnectEnabled = true`)
- The app remembers the last connected device UUID
- Manual disconnects set a flag to prevent auto-reconnect
- Bluetooth state changes now properly reset the auto-reconnect attempt flag
