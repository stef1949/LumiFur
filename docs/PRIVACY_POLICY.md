LumiFur Privacy Policy

Effective date: 12 December 2025
App name: LumiFur

1) Who we are (Data Controller)

LumiFur is provided by [Richies 3D Ltd] (“we”, “us”). We are the data controller for personal data processed through the app.

Address: [6 Mitre House, 149 Western Road, Brighton]
Country: United Kingdom

2) What this policy covers

This policy explains how we handle information when you use LumiFur, a SwiftUI iOS app designed to control fursuit LED/light systems (e.g., LED matrices/arrays) using connectivity such as Bluetooth and, where enabled, Wi-Fi. 
GitHub

3) Summary

No account required.

We do not sell your data.

We do not run third-party ad tracking.

Connectivity data (Bluetooth / local network) is used to connect to your controller device and send commands. 
GitHub

Most data stays on your device unless you choose to share it (e.g., by emailing logs).

4) Information we collect and use
A) Data you provide

Support messages (if you contact us): your email address and what you send us (message content, attachments).
Purpose: support and troubleshooting.
Legal basis (GDPR/UK GDPR): legitimate interests (support) and/or contract (providing the app/service).

B) Data processed to make the app work (connectivity & device control)

LumiFur may process the following on your device to connect to and control your LED controller hardware: 
GitHub

Bluetooth information: nearby device discovery results (e.g., device name broadcast, identifiers assigned by iOS, signal strength/RSSI) and connection state.

Local network/Wi-Fi information (if you use Wi-Fi control): your controller’s local IP/host details and connection status on your local network.

Purpose: to discover, connect to, and communicate with your controller device and apply your lighting settings/patterns. 
GitHub

Legal basis: performance of a contract (providing core app functionality) and legitimate interests (ensuring reliable connectivity).

Note on “location”: LumiFur does not request your GPS location to function. However, Bluetooth scans and network information can be considered personal data because they may indirectly relate to your environment or devices.

C) Data received from your controller device (telemetry)

Depending on your firmware/controller features, LumiFur may display and store locally values such as:

device status/metadata (e.g., firmware version/build info),

sensor/telemetry readings exposed by the controller (e.g., temperature),

settings state (e.g., brightness, selected animation/view, feature toggles).

Purpose: show device state in-app, enable features like status displays and history graphs, and help troubleshooting.
Legal basis: contract (core functionality) and legitimate interests (diagnostics).

D) App preferences stored on your device

We store your settings locally (e.g., last connected device, UI preferences, lighting presets) using iOS storage mechanisms such as app storage/UserDefaults.

Purpose: remember your preferences.
Legal basis: contract (provide expected functionality).

E) Diagnostics and crash data

If you install via the App Store/TestFlight, Apple may provide us aggregated crash information and diagnostics depending on your Apple settings and distribution channel.

If LumiFur includes an in-app “export logs” option, any logs are only shared if you choose to share them.

Purpose: stability and bug fixing.
Legal basis: legitimate interests.

5) What we don’t collect

We do not intentionally collect:

precise location,

contacts,

photos/camera,

microphone recordings,

advertising identifiers (IDFA),

data for cross-app tracking.

6) How we share data

We only share personal data:

With service providers we use to operate support or distribution (e.g., Apple’s App Store/TestFlight infrastructure), to the extent applicable.

If required by law (e.g., lawful request by authorities).

With your consent (e.g., if you choose to send logs via email).

We do not sell personal data.

7) International transfers

If we use providers that process data outside the UK/EEA (for example, some global cloud email providers), we will ensure appropriate safeguards (e.g., adequacy regulations or Standard Contractual Clauses) where required.

8) Data retention

On-device data (preferences, recent device info, telemetry history) is kept until you delete the app or use any in-app reset/clear options.

Support emails are retained only as long as needed to resolve your request and maintain records of support, then deleted or anonymised on a reasonable schedule.

9) Security

We use reasonable technical and organisational measures to protect data, including:

limiting data collection to what’s needed for device control,

relying on iOS security features (sandboxing, system permissions),

recommending you keep iOS up to date.

Because Bluetooth and local networks are shared environments, you should only connect to controller devices you trust.

10) Your GDPR/UK GDPR rights

If you are in the UK/EEA, you have rights including:

access to your personal data,

correction,

deletion,

restriction,

objection,

portability (where applicable),

withdrawal of consent (where we rely on consent).

To exercise rights, contact [privacy@richies.uk
]. We may need to verify your identity.

11) Complaints

You can complain to your local data protection authority.
If you’re in the UK: Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO).

12) Children

LumiFur is not directed to children under 13 (or the relevant age of digital consent in your country). We do not knowingly collect personal data from children.

13) Changes to this policy

We may update this policy to reflect app changes (for example, if online features are added). We will update the “Effective date” and, where appropriate, notify you in-app or via the App Store listing.
