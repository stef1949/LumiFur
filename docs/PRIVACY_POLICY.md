Effective date: 12 December 2025

Country: United Kingdom


## 2) What this policy covers

This policy explains how we handle information when you use **LumiFur**, a SwiftUI iOS app designed to control fursuit LED/light systems (for example LED matrices or arrays) using connectivity such as Bluetooth and, where enabled, Wi-Fi.


## 3) Summary

- No account is required.
- We do **not** sell your data.
- We do **not** run third-party ad tracking.
- Connectivity data (Bluetooth or local network) is used to connect to your controller device and send commands.
- Most data stays on your device unless you choose to share it (for example by emailing logs).


## 4) Information we collect and use

### A) Data you provide

**Support messages**

If you contact us for support, we may receive:

- your email address
- the content of your message
- any attachments you choose to send

**Purpose**

Support and troubleshooting.

**Legal basis (GDPR / UK GDPR)**

Legitimate interests (support) and/or contract (providing the app or service).


### B) Data processed to make the app work (connectivity and device control)

LumiFur may process the following on your device to connect to and control your LED controller hardware:

- **Bluetooth information** such as nearby device discovery results (for example broadcast device names, identifiers assigned by iOS, and signal strength / RSSI) and connection state.
- **Local network or Wi-Fi information** such as your controller’s IP or host details and connectivity status (when Wi-Fi control is enabled).

**Purpose**

To discover, connect to, and communicate with your controller device and to apply lighting settings or patterns.

**Legal basis**

Performance of a contract (core app functionality) and legitimate interests (ensuring reliable connectivity).

> Note on location: LumiFur does not request your GPS location.  
> However, Bluetooth scans and network information can indirectly relate to your environment or devices and may be considered personal data.


### C) Data received from your controller device (telemetry)

Depending on your firmware and device features, LumiFur may display and store locally:

- device metadata (for example firmware version)
- sensor or telemetry readings (for example temperature)
- settings state (for example brightness, animation mode, feature toggles)

**Purpose**

To show device state in the app, enable status or history features, and assist with troubleshooting.

**Legal basis**

Performance of a contract and legitimate interests.


### D) App preferences stored on your device

LumiFur stores preferences locally using iOS storage mechanisms such as UserDefaults. This may include:

- last connected device
- UI preferences
- lighting presets

**Purpose**

To remember your preferences and provide the expected user experience.

**Legal basis**

Performance of a contract.


### E) Diagnostics and crash data

- If you install LumiFur via the App Store or TestFlight, Apple may provide us with aggregated crash and diagnostic information depending on your device settings and Apple’s policies.
- If LumiFur provides an option to export logs, those logs are only shared if you choose to send them to us (for example by email).

**Purpose**

To improve stability and fix bugs.

**Legal basis**

Legitimate interests.


## 5) What we do not collect

We do not intentionally collect:

- precise GPS location
- contacts
- photos or camera content
- microphone recordings
- advertising identifiers (IDFA)
- data used for cross-app tracking


## 6) How we share data

We share personal data only:

- with service providers that help us operate support or distribution (for example Apple’s App Store or TestFlight), where applicable
- when required by law (for example a lawful request by authorities)
- with your consent (for example when you choose to email logs or screenshots to us)

We do not sell personal data.


## 7) International transfers

If we use providers that process data outside the UK or EEA, we will put in place appropriate safeguards where required, such as UK adequacy regulations or Standard Contractual Clauses.


## 8) Data retention

- **On-device data** (preferences, recent device information, telemetry history) is kept until you delete the app or use any in-app reset or clear options.
- **Support emails** are retained only as long as needed to resolve your request and maintain reasonable records of support, and are then deleted or anonymised.


## 9) Security

We use reasonable technical and organisational measures to protect data, including:

- limiting data collection to what is needed for device control and support
- relying on iOS security features such as sandboxing and system permissions
- recommending that you keep your device and iOS up to date

Because Bluetooth and local networks are shared environments, you should only connect to controller devices that you trust.


## 10) Your GDPR / UK GDPR rights

If you are in the UK or EEA, you have rights which may include:

- access to your personal data
- correction of inaccurate data
- deletion of your data
- restriction of processing
- objection to certain processing
- data portability (where applicable)
- withdrawal of consent (where we rely on consent)

To exercise these rights, contact:

Email: privacy@richies.uk

We may need to verify your identity before completing your request.


## 11) Complaints

You can complain to your local data protection authority if you have concerns about how we handle your personal data.

In the UK, this is the **Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO)**.


## 12) Children

LumiFur is not directed to children under 13 years of age (or the relevant age of digital consent in your country). We do not knowingly collect personal data from children.

If you believe a child has provided us with personal data, please contact us so that we can delete it.


## 13) Changes to this policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time, for example when LumiFur gains new features or when legal requirements change.

When we make changes, we will update the effective date at the top of this document and, where appropriate, notify you in the app or via the App Store listing.
