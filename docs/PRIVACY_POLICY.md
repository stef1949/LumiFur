---

## 2) What this policy covers

This policy explains how we handle information when you use **LumiFur**, a SwiftUI iOS app designed to control fursuit LED/light systems (e.g., LED matrices/arrays) using connectivity such as Bluetooth and, where enabled, Wi-Fi.

---

## 3) Summary

- No account required.  
- We do **not** sell your data.  
- We do **not** run third-party ad tracking.  
- Connectivity data (Bluetooth / local network) is used to connect to your controller device and send commands.  
- Most data stays on your device unless you choose to share it (e.g., emailing logs).

---

## 4) Information we collect and use

### A) Data you provide
- **Support messages:** your email address and message content (including attachments).  
**Purpose:** support & troubleshooting  
**Legal basis (GDPR/UK GDPR):** legitimate interests (support), and/or contract (providing the app/service)

---

### B) Data processed to make the app work (connectivity & device control)

LumiFur may process the following on your device to connect to and control your LED controller hardware:

- **Bluetooth information:** nearby device discovery results (e.g., broadcast device names, iOS-assigned identifiers, RSSI/signal strength), connection state  
- **Local network/Wi-Fi information:** controller IP/host details and connectivity status (if Wi-Fi control is enabled)

**Purpose:** discover, connect to, and communicate with your controller device; apply lighting settings/patterns  
**Legal basis:** performance of a contract (core app functionality) & legitimate interests (reliable connectivity)

> **Note on “location”:** LumiFur does *not* request GPS location.  
> However, Bluetooth scans and network information can indirectly relate to your environment or devices and may be considered personal data.

---

### C) Data received from your controller device (telemetry)

Depending on firmware/device features, LumiFur may display/store locally:

- device metadata (e.g., firmware version)
- sensor/telemetry readings (e.g., temperature)
- settings state (brightness, animation, toggles)

**Purpose:** show device state, enable status/history features, assist troubleshooting  
**Legal basis:** contract & legitimate interests

---

### D) App preferences stored on your device

Stored locally using iOS mechanisms (e.g., UserDefaults):

- last connected device
- UI preferences
- lighting presets

**Purpose:** remember your preferences  
**Legal basis:** contract

---

### E) Diagnostics and crash data

- If installed via the App Store/TestFlight, Apple may provide aggregated crash/diagnostic information depending on your device settings.
- Logs are only shared if you choose to export/send them.

**Purpose:** app stability & bug fixing  
**Legal basis:** legitimate interests

---

## 5) What we don’t collect

We do **not intentionally collect:**

- precise location  
- contacts  
- photos/camera  
- microphone recordings  
- advertising identifiers (IDFA)  
- data for cross-app tracking

---

## 6) How we share data

We share personal data only:

- with service providers used for support/distribution (e.g., Apple)  
- if required by law  
- with your consent (e.g., emailing logs)

We **do not sell** personal data.

---

## 7) International transfers

If providers process data outside the UK/EEA, we ensure appropriate safeguards (e.g., adequacy regulations or Standard Contractual Clauses) where required.

---

## 8) Data retention

- **On-device data:** retained until you delete the app or reset/clear data in-app  
- **Support emails:** kept only as long as reasonably required, then deleted or anonymised

---

## 9) Security

We use reasonable technical and organisational measures, including:

- limiting data collection to what’s needed  
- relying on iOS security features (sandboxing, permissions)  
- recommending you keep iOS updated

> Because Bluetooth/local networks are shared environments, only connect to controller devices you trust.

---

If you are in the UK/EEA, you may request:

- access  
- correction  
- deletion  
- restriction  
- objection
