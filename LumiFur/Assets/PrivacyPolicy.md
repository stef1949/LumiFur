## 2. What this policy covers

This policy explains how we handle information when you use LumiFur, a SwiftUI iOS app designed to control LED/light systems (such as LED matrices) in fursuit and wearable applications via Bluetooth and, where enabled, Wi-Fi.

---

## 3. Summary

- No account required
- We do **not** sell your data
- We do **not** run third-party advertising or tracking
- Connectivity data (Bluetooth / local network) is used to connect to your controller device
- Most data remains on your device unless you choose to share it (e.g., emailing logs)

---

## 4. Information we collect and use

### A) Data you provide
- Support messages (if you contact us): your email and any details you send

**Purpose:** support and troubleshooting
**Legal basis:** legitimate interests and/or contract

---

### B) Data processed to make the app work (connectivity & device control)

LumiFur processes on-device data needed to connect to and control your hardware:

- **Bluetooth information:** device discovery results, iOS-assigned identifiers, RSSI/signal strength, connection status
- **Local network information (if used):** controller IP/host details, connection status

**Purpose:** discover, connect to, and communicate with your controller device
**Legal basis:** contract and legitimate interests

> **Note:** LumiFur does **not** request GPS.
> However, Bluetooth scans and network details may be considered personal data because they relate to nearby devices.

---

### C) Data received from your controller (telemetry)

Depending on your controller/firmware configuration, the app may receive and store locally:

- device metadata (e.g., firmware version)
- telemetry (e.g., temperature readings)
- current settings (brightness, animation mode, feature toggles)

**Purpose:** display device state, enable history features, assist diagnostics
**Legal basis:** contract and legitimate interests

---

### D) App preferences stored on your device

Stored using iOS storage mechanisms such as `UserDefaults`:

- last connected device
- UI preferences
- lighting presets

**Purpose:** remember your preferences
**Legal basis:** contract

---

### E) Diagnostics and crash data

- Apple may provide aggregated diagnostics depending on your settings
- Logs are only shared if you choose to export them

**Purpose:** stability and bug fixing
**Legal basis:** legitimate interests

---

## 5. What we don’t collect

LumiFur does **not intentionally collect:**

- precise GPS location
- contacts
- photos or camera access
- microphone recordings
- advertising identifiers (IDFA)
- cross-app tracking data

---

## 6. How we share data

We only share personal data:

- with service providers used for distribution/support (e.g., Apple)
- if required by law
- **with your consent**, such as sending logs via email

We **do not sell** personal data.

---

## 7. International transfers

If any providers process data outside the UK/EEA, we ensure appropriate safeguards such as adequacy regulations or Standard Contractual Clauses where required.

---

## 8. Data retention

- On-device data is retained until you delete the app or clear in-app storage
- Support emails are retained only as long as reasonably necessary, then deleted or anonymised

---

## 9. Security

We apply reasonable measures to protect data:

- limit data collection to what is necessary
- rely on iOS security features (app sandbox, permissions)
- recommend keeping iOS updated

> Because Bluetooth and local networks are shared environments, only connect to devices you trust.

---

If you are in the UK/EEA, you may request:

- access, correction, deletion
- restriction or objection
- portability (where applicable)
- withdrawal of consent (where consent is used)
